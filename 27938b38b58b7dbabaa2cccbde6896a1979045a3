      "message": "\u003e This is a very good point but I think that discriminating between Sync/Async is not the right view. \n\nThe point that Sa≈°a is making is that *IF* you tell the client that a \"git push went through\" you are assuming that the replication will always go well. It is not actually always the case, because if the server-1 blows up (all destroyed, including data) before the data gets replicated to server-2, the push data has gone.\n\n\u003e I think we should rather talk about the durability of the replication information and the failure of write operation if the publication of the replication info fails.\n\nReplication is already durable: it will eventually be replicated assuming that server-1 did not blow up (my example above).\n\n\u003e In this case we could have eventual consistency and no data loss in Async mode.\n\nNot always, that\u0027s why \"sync replication\" is the 100% loss-less, otherwise you have a probability of inconsistency (let\u0027s say 99.999% loss-less but not 100%).\n\nThe CAP theorem is telling us that you can\u0027t have C(onsistency) + A(vailability) + P(erformance) at the same time.\n\nI believe that letting the user chose which one to give priority to is the right way, including \"sync replication\" when needed.",
