      "message": "Why? How is that different from AWS? I believe that both AWS and GCE would require to have a reverse proxy in the cloud because they do not directly allow to have on-premises IP entries associated with their geo-located DNS.\n\nWith both you could still have Gerrit on-premises and have just a proxy on the cloud.\n\nWDYT?",
