Then, the plugin can evolve at its own pace, without any dependency from the multi-site plugin.\n\n\u003e If this change is needed at some point (I think it is, because the KafkaProp prefix is counter-intuitive and redundant now)\n\nSounds good, however, I do not believe this is our priority right now.\nWe do this decoupling NOT because we want to make the Kafka plugin easier or simpler, but rather because we want to have *other* PubSub mechanisms (AWS Kinesis, GCloud PubSub, anything else).\n\n\u003e I think it should be done here rather than elsewhere as this will allow to track it as a \"change\" in git.\n\nI do not see the point of breaking multi-site backward compatibility just for a \"nicer property name\", which is possibly not our focus anyway.\n\n\u003e Are you worried about breaking back-compatibility with the current multi-site.config?\n\nYes, and without a \"good enough\" reason also rather than an unpleasant name.",
