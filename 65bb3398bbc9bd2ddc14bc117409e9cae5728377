      "message": "I was trying to use this code to bind NoOp implementation when dynamic item is defined in events-broker but there is no actual implementation binded(KafkaBrokerApi). Unfortunately this code doesn\u0027t work and later in the code dynamic item is always returning null. Interesting thing is that when we have binding from kafka-event plugin(KafkaBrokerApi) dynamic item is returning correct kafka implementation. Any idea why this binding is not working?",
