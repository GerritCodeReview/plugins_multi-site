      "message": "Based on the change 245113 in HA plugin, the index events involved are:\n- Accounts\n- Changes\n\nAnd for that reason in multi-site plugin only those index events have been treated. \n\nIn the current code there is only one test `shouldNotForwardIndexChangeIfCurrentThreadIsPullReplicationApplyObject` and I have added 2 tests regarding the `changes`.\n\nI have done a E2E test in multisite local setup for `changes`:\n- Online index: `ssh   -p 39418 admin@localhost gerrit index start accounts --force`\n\n- Checking events in kafka topic `gerrit_batch_index`: `kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic gerrit_batch_index  --from-beginning`\n\nRegarding `accounts` I tried as explained above but for some reason it did not work so I would like to have some guidance.",
