      "message": "I agree, the solution is quite complicated here.\n\n1. If we merge as-is, we won\u0027t be able to serve the `has:drafts` queries consistently in multi-site\n2. If revert 135d416f in this merge, we will be back with infinite retries when the draft comments events are not propagated\n\nWe need to make a *proper fix* on stable-3.9 first and then merge this branch. I would not recommend make the fix as part of the merge, as it would make it quite confusing.",
