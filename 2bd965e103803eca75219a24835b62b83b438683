      "message": "This needs a bit of explanation. In 2.16 branch both modules are kafka dependent. We cannot have ForwardedEventRouterModule enabled without kafka subscriber enabled as well. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve moved that check inside ForwardedEventRouterModule. Again in 2.16 we don\u0027t have alternative option when are installing ForwardedEventRouterModule we have to install KafkaConsumerModule as well that\u0027s why I\u0027ve moved this installation inside ForwardedEventRouterModule. I was thinking about leaving KafkaConsumerModule and do the enable/disable check inside every module independently as well. WDYT?",
