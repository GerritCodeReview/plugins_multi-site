You could have the \"lastest\" of 2 years ago on your local Docker daemon and you\u0027ll not even realise it :-(\n\nAs a matter of fact, \"latest\" could be very very old and not the latest at all.\n\n\u003e In AWS, they always run the only available version of kinesis, aka the \"latest\". Differently from other SaaS, we have no way of pin our deployment to a particular version.\n\nTrue, but this is a local dev environment that allows us to write our own code.\nWhen you test on AWS, you\u0027ll have to use whatever is there.\n\n\u003e With this assumption, I think running the local environment with the latest released kinesis API is safer, as it will be closer to the _actual_ condition in which multi-site will run.\n\nThe local environment isn\u0027t an integration test at all: having \"latest\" would allow people to run NOT the latest at all :-(\n\nImagine someone is saying \"I ran your environment and doesn\u0027t work because I get a strange error from Kinesis\". You ask: \"what version of the localstack you are using\" ? He says: \"the latest\" .... and then you have no idea of what he is running.\n\nThe setup of a local dev environment is for developing *your code* and not for testing AWS :-)",
